# ESCI-S: extended metadata for Amazon ESCI dataset

[![License: Apache 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache2-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)


This is a complimentary dataset of product metadata for the original [Amazon ESCI](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data) dataset.
> ESCI is a large dataset of difficult search queries, released with the aim of fostering research in the area of semantic matching of queries and products. For each query, the dataset provides a list of up to 40 potentially relevant results, together with ESCI relevance judgements (Exact, Substitute, Complement, Irrelevant) indicating the relevance of the product to the query. Each query-product pair is accompanied by additional product information.

## Data

* Full dataset, 1.66M products, 3.4G [Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compressed: [S3](https://esci-s.s3.amazonaws.com/esci.json.zst) [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZLeUg61GWU3A6xyUEIw9AJtR-AwK5aw/view?usp=share_link)
* 0.25% sample, 4400 products, 10M compressed: [Github LFS](https://github.com/shuttie/esci-s/raw/master/sample.json.gz)

## Motivation

As an e-commerce dataset, the ESCI is focused on text information about products and queries, **leaving behavioral, numerical and categorical ranking features on the side**. The original product information includes the following fields:
* product_id
* product_title
* product_description
* product_bullet_point
* product_brand
* product_color
* product_locale

It references ~1.8M unique products, and our goal was to enrich product metadata with non-textual information, which is typical for e-commerce applications. 

## Methodology

As product_id is technically an [ASIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number), a global amazon-wide product identifier, so we scraped and parsed all 1.8M referenced products, extending the original ESCI dataset with the following extra fields:
* `type` - is it a book or a product?
* `stars` - average review score
* `ratings` - number of reviews
* `category` - list of categories (from top to bottom)
* `attributes` - a map of product attributes, displayed under the reviews block.
* `bullets` - a list of product bullet points, should be the same as original `product_bullet_point` field
* `description` - product main description
* `info` - an extended map of product attributes, displayed under the description.
* `reviews` - a structured set of review data (`stars`, `title`, `date`, `text`)
* `price` - original price
* `formats` - a map of available product formats (for example, kindle and paperback forms with their prices)
* `template` - page layout template, usually correlated with the top category
* `image` - URL of the main image
* `locale` - main language of the page

Books do have a couple of specific extra fields:
* `subtitle` - a secondary title
* `author` - book author name
* `review` - extra book review from Amazon

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸n July 13, 2017",
      "text": "Overall a nice looking case. Magnet is relatively strong to keep it closed. Another nice feature is that the 2 sides of the case are also magnetized, so they hold when you fold the top under/behind the phone (so it doesn't flap around). This was a pleasant surprise, and then you can secure it with the tab as well. I agree that the mirror is not as useful, since it's more of a fun house mirror (image is distorted). But if you're using it up close for lipstick or to get something out of your teeth or eye or to spy on the person behind you, it'll do fine. :-) The wallet is stylish and the material feels good, not like cheap or inflexible plastic. But the accent color is not silver like it appears, it's more of a glittery or metallic gold. It's nice though. I also agree with others that if you were to drop your phone, the case may open up, as the magnet is strong, but it's not fully secured closed. I don't plan on testing that though! You should still get a screen protector. The only downside to the wallet case is that the wrist strap is at the top of the case. I have a Galaxy S8+, which is really long. When I wear the strap around my wrist, it's almost impossible to hold the phone in the same hand. I commute standing on a train, so one hand use of the phone is important, as well as the safety net to wearing the wristlet on my wrist. I've tried with both hands. You just can't get to the keyboard to even Swype. Placing the strap at the bottom of the case would be more effective and useful, especially on the larger phones. I'd give the case 5 stars if the strap were placed at the bottom and more useable."

      "text": "I got this around Spring break, so I have had it for a good 2 months almost. And I personally am really hard on my phone cases. I swing this around and am constantly playing with the magnet closing. That being said, the magnet on this case is VERY good. But, I have managed to tear up the side. First thing I noticed when it came, was the cute quote where the phone goes, a big appreciation for that. It isn't GREAT quality, but definitely really good when you compare the case to the price of what it was. The pockets in the case are a little tight at first, I stretched mine by making sure I could move my finger in them. The strap hole is very durable. The only complaint I might have, is the case makes it difficult to take rear face pictures. I usually end up popping my phone out for that, but overall I actually really love this case :)"

      "text": "I have a galaxy 8+. This keeps it covered nicely. Has a tiny magnet to secure the side. The pockets get stretched so cards can fall out if the case gets upside down. The binding gets soft over time so it doesn't act as a good stand on its own. I lean it on something. I'd like to see the same magnet flap over the card area to keep them from falling out. Over all is a good case for the money, very attractive sleek look."
